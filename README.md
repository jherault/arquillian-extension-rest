## Arquillian REST Extension

**Arquillian REST extension** is currently a draft and is not working

Take a look at the test file [RestExtensionTest.java](https://github.com/jherault/arquillian-extension-rest/blob/master/int-tests/src/test/java/org/jboss/arquillian/example/RESTExtensionTest.java) to see what I would like to do.
